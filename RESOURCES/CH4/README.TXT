To play in emaga4, simply copy this directory, all its contents,
plus the sub-directories to you hard drive, and then double-click
on tge.exe in the new location on your hard disk.

Running EmagaCh4KitInstall.exe will install the emaga4 sample game to
c:\emaga4. However, this will NOT install the code modules that are covered
in Chapter 4. If you want the source code for the modules covered in
Chapter 4, you can find them here in the control directory.
