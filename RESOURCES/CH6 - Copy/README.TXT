SINGLE PLAYER MODE

To play in single-player mode, simply double-click on tge.exe, click the mouse button
to dismiss the startup splash screen, then click on Start Game

MULTIPLAYER / DEDICATED SERVER MODE

To play this game in multiplayer mode, you need launch emaga6 in dedicated
server mode, and then launch it *again* normally.

1. In a Command shell, change to the emaga6 directory (ie. "cd c:\emaga6")
and then type in this command:

tge.exe -dedicated -mission control/data/maps/book_ch6.mis

You will see a display of console output from the game server, which
should end with the message "*** Mission Loaded"


2. Next, double-click on tge.exe in the emaga6 directory, click the mouse button
to dismiss the startup splash screen, then click on Connect To Server



There is also a shortcut provided to launch the game in dedicated server mode,
however, if you copy the directory to another computer, you may need to change
the paths in the shortcut if you use a different hard drive on the other computer.
